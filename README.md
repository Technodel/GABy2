# SUNy — Smart Unstoppable Navigator

SUNy is an AI coding sidekick that doesn't just suggest — it executes. Give it a goal in plain English, and it reads your project, plans the work, writes the code, runs the tests, and keeps going until the goal is done.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** and **npm**
- One or more LLM API keys (Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, etc.)
- A domain with SSL if deploying publicly (optional)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd suny
npm install
cd src/renderer && npm install && cd ../..

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set at minimum:
#   SUNY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your-admin-password>
#   SUNY_SECRET_JWT=<random-32-char-string>
#   SUNY_GROQ_KEY=<your-groq-api-key>

# 3. Run development
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. Login with admin / your password.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or deploy with Docker:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for full VPS/nginx/SSL deployment guide.

## Core Concepts

### 🔄 The Agent Loop

SUNy uses Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` with native tool calling. The flow:

1. **Analyze** — reads your project, understands architecture
2. **Plan** — creates a step-by-step plan
3. **Execute** — writes files, runs commands, checks outputs
4. **Verify** — runs lint, tests, type-checking automatically
5. **Retry** — if something fails, tries a different approach
6. **Complete** — delivers proof of completion

No XML parsing, no hallucinated tool calls. The AI SDK handles the loop natively.

### 🧠 SUNy Code Conscience

A persistent design memory and intent-aware change guardian:

- **Design Memory** — remembers every design decision across sessions
- **Change Guardian** — snapshots TypeScript signatures before changes, detects semantic drift
- **Compounds over time** — the more you use it, the smarter it gets

### 🎯 Goal Tracking

Persistent goal stack that survives across sessions. SUNy remembers what it was working on and picks up exactly where it left off — not from chat history, but from the goal's measured state with success criteria and evidence collection.

### 🔋 Modes

| Mode | Cost | Use Case |
|------|------|----------|
| ⚡ Free | Almost free | Quick tasks, simple questions |
| 🚀 Fast Smart | Low | Coding, debugging, everyday tasks |
| 🧠 Smart Pro | Moderate | Complex analysis, deep reasoning |

### 🔐 Billing

Credit-based with transparent pricing. Admins set balances, users see their remaining credits at all times. No surprise charges.

### 🔌 IDE Bridge

VS Code extension that connects SUNy directly to your editor. Changes appear in real time without copy-paste.
